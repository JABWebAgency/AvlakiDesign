            Avlaki installs exterior sump basins where water can not be directed
            with the assistance of gravity. These systems direct water to a
            large basin and with the assistance of a pump the water is then
            redirected to a new location. These systems are designed to mitigate
            the toughest of water problems.

            Our dry wells are designed with a capture basin that is allowed to
            percolate to the soils. This effective solution works very well when
            sandy soils are present. A dry well is a great option when water
            needs to be maintained within the boundaries of the property.
