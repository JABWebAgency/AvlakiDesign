            <h2>Exterior Sump Wells</h2>
            <p>At Avlaki, we offer the installation of exterior sump wells to help manage excess water around your
                property. Exterior sump wells are designed to collect and store groundwater before it can cause flooding
                or damage to your foundation. Equipped with a pump, the system efficiently moves water away from the
                home, providing long-term protection against water buildup and ensuring a dry, secure environment for
                your property.
            <h2>Dry Wells</h2>
            <p>We also specialize in dry wells, a sustainable solution for draining excess water on your property. A dry
                well is an underground system that collects and temporarily stores water, allowing it to slowly
                percolate into the surrounding soil. This solution is ideal for areas with poor drainage or where water
                needs to be diverted away from structures, helping to prevent pooling and erosion while maintaining a
                healthy landscape.</p>
