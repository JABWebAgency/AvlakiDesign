            <h2>Curtain Drains</h2>
            <p>At Avlaki, we specialize in installing curtain drains to help manage groundwater around your property.
                Curtain drains are typically placed along foundations or slopes to intercept and redirect water before
                it can cause damage. This system is highly effective in preventing water from pooling near sensitive
                areas, protecting your foundation and landscaping from potential flooding.</p>
            <h2>French Drains</h2>
            <p>We also offer the installation of French drains, a reliable solution for managing excess water around
                your property. French drains consist of a trench filled with gravel and a perforated pipe that channels
                water away from areas prone to flooding. This system helps reduce water buildup and prevents damage to
                your foundation, keeping your property safe and dry throughout the year.</p>
