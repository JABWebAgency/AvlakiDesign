            and no fines round aggregates, our french drain systems are built to

            Avlaki installs curtain drains to capture subsurface movement of
            water. This typically takes place on hillsides where extreme
            separation of soils is present. Water moving subsurface requires a
            precise attention to detail, in order to capture and redirect.
            Curtain drains are very similar to french drains in construction,
            however they are larger in design.
