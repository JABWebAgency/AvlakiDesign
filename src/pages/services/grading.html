            <h2>Grading</h2>
            <p>At Avlaki, our grading services are designed to improve the flow of water around your property. By
                reshaping the land to ensure proper slope and drainage, we help prevent water from pooling near
                foundations, walkways, or other critical areas. Our expert team works with precision to create a grade
                that directs water away from your home, reducing the risk of flooding, erosion, and water damage. </p>
            <h2>Excavating</h2>
            <p>We also offer professional excavating services to support various drainage solutions and property
                improvements. Whether it's digging trenches for drainage systems, removing soil, or preparing land for
                new construction, our experienced crew uses advanced equipment to get the job done efficiently and
                safely. With our excavating services, we ensure your property is properly prepared for effective water
                management and long-lasting stability.</p>
