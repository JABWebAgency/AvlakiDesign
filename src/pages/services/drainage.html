            <h2>Downspouts</h2>
            <p>At Avlaki, we provide expert downspout drainage services to help direct rainwater away from your
                home. By installing or repairing downspouts, we ensure that water flows safely away from your roof and
                foundation, preventing water damage and flooding. Our team can also help with proper downspout
                extensions, guiding water to designated areas for optimal drainage and reducing the risk of erosion or
                pooling near your foundation.</p>
            <h2>Foundation Drainage</h2>
            <p>We also specialize in foundation drainage solutions, designed to protect your homeâ€™s foundation from the
                damaging effects of water. Our foundation drainage systems are installed around the perimeter of your
                home to direct water away from the foundation, reducing the risk of cracks, leaks, and moisture buildup.
                With our professional installation and maintenance services, we ensure your foundation remains dry and
                secure, preserving the structural integrity of your property.</p>
