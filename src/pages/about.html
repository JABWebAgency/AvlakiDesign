      <p class="cs-text">
        You may be wondering, what does “Avlaki” mean? It’s a Greek word that
        translates to “furrow” or “drain.” Because our company specializes in
        water management, we chose a name that directly reflects what we do
        best—drainage.
      </p>
      <p class="cs-text">
        With over 20 years of experience in landscaping and excavation, we’ve
        encountered every type of drainage challenge, from basic French drains
        to complex exterior sump systems. At Avlaki, we blend trusted,
        time-tested techniques with modern technology to design solutions that
        not only address your immediate needs but also give you lasting peace of
        mind. When you choose Avlaki, you’re choosing a system built to stand
        the test of time—so you can stay focused on what matters most.
