      <p class="cs-text">
        What does Avlaki mean? I get this question all the time with a blank
        stare. I felt the name of a business that specializes in drainage and
        water should be named after one. Avlaki, is greek for - to furrow/drain.
      </p>
      <p class="cs-text">
        With 20+ years of working in the landscaping/ excavation industry's, we
        have seen some issues. From simply french drains to elaborate exterior
        sump systems. Avlaki, uses old and new technology to create a system
        that will not only solve your problem today but you won't have to ever
        think about it again.
