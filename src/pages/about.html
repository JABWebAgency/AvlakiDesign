            <p class="cs-text">
                What does Avlaki mean? I get this question all the time with a blank stare. I felt the name of a
                business that specializes in drainage and water should be named after one. Avlaki, is greek for - to
                furrow/drain.
            </p>
            <p class="cs-text">
                With 20+ years of working in the landscaping/ excavation industry's, we have seen some issues. From
                simply french drains to elaborate exterior sump systems. Avlaki, uses old and new technology to create a
                system that will not only solve your problem today but you won't have to ever think about it again.
